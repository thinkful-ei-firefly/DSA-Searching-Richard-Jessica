1. How many searches?
Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 8.

Step 1: algorithm checks value 11. 11 > 8, so end index is set to [3].
Step 2: algortihm checks value 5. 5 < 8, so start index is set to [2].
Step 3: algortihm checks value 6. 6 < 8, so start index is set to [3].
Step 4: algortihm checks value 8. 8 === 8, so the algorithm returns index [3].

Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 16.

Step 1: algorithm checks value 11. 11 < 16, so start index is set to [5].
Step 2: algortihm checks value 14. 14 < 16, so start index is set to [7].
Step 3: algorithm checks value 17. 17 > 16, so end index is set to [7].
Step 4: algorithm checks value 15. 15 < 16, so start index is set to [8].
Step 5: start index [8] > end index [7], so the algorithm returns -1 (item not found).
